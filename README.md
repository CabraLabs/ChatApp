### ChatApp
Look at the [Preview Images](./Preview.md).

ChatApp is a simple local chat for Android. Features included in the chat are:
- Text messages
- Audio messages
- Pictures (can be sent from the gallery or taken at the moment)
- Avatar profiles
- Usernames
- Interactive commands (such as /vibrate)

The app implements its own message protocol and uses JSON to send messages across connected members.

ChatApp needs a host to work, anyone with the app installed can run the server (which is an android foreground service) and send their IP and port to people who have the app installed.
